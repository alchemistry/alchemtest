# packages (because it does not actually import the Python packages).
# We declare the package not-zip-safe so that our type hints are also available
# when checking client code that uses our (installed) package.

# See also:
#   https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html#setuptools-specific-configuration
# Note that behavior is currently evolving with respect to how to interpret the
# "data" and "tests" subdirectories. As of setuptools 63, both are automatically
# included if namespaces is true (default), even if the package is named explicitly
# (instead of using 'find'). With 'find', the 'tests' subpackage is discovered
# recursively because of its __init__.py file, but the data subdirectory is excluded
# with include-package-data = false and namespaces = false.

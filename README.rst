===========================================

|doi| |docs|

**alchemtest**  is a collection of test datasets for alchemical free energy calculations.
The datasets come from a variety of software packages, primarily molecular
dynamics engines, and are used as the test set for `alchemlyb`_.
The package is standalone, however, and can be used for any purpose.

Datasets are released under an `open license`_ that conforms to the
`Open Definition 2.1`_ that allows free use, re-use, redistribution,

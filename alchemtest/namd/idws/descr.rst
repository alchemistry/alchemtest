NAMD: free energy of dummy ethane to ethane "mutation" in aqueous solution
==========================================================================

Free energy change from mutating an ethane molecule into an ethane molecule, 
turning a H atom into a methyl group and conversely.
Expected free energy is zero, however the dataset is tiny (sufficient for
testing purposes).
Uses Interleaved Double-Wide Sampling (Hénin and Brannigan).

Data Set Characteristics:
    :Number of Legs: 1 (forward mutation in water with IDWS sampling)
    :Number of Windows: 11
    :Length of Windows: 50 ps (each window interspersed with 5 ps equilibration)
    :System Size: 1030 atoms
    :Temperature: 300 K

    :Alchemical Pathway: dummy mutation of ethane into ethane using dual topology
                         hybrid molecule. Nonbonded interactions of perturbed
                         atoms are scaled with their environment.

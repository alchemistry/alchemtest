NAMD: free energy of tyrosine to alanine in vacuo
=================================================

Free energy change from mutating a Tyr into Ala in vacuo.
Uses Interleaved Double-Wide Sampling (HÃ©nin and Brannigan).
Each lambda window was run separately, and NAMD was interrupted
and restarted multiple times, such that one window may span
multiple fepout files.

Data Set Characteristics:
    :Number of Legs: 1 (forward mutation with IDWS sampling)
    :Number of Windows: 11
    :Length of Windows: 50 ps
    :System Size: 57 atoms
    :Temperature: 300 K
    :Alchemical Pathway: Mutation of Tyr into Ala using hybrid molecule.
                         Nonbonded interactions of perturbed atoms are scaled
                         with their environment.
    :Missing Values: None

NAMD: free energy of tyrosine to alanine in vacuo
=================================================

Free energy change from mutating a Tyr into Ala in vacuo.
Uses Interleaved Double-Wide Sampling (HÃ©nin and Brannigan).
Each lambda window was run separately, and NAMD was interrupted
and restarted multiple times, such that one window may span
multiple fepout files.

Derived from NAMD FEP Tutorial, available at:
https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/namd/FEP/

This calculation was run from lambda = 1.0 to lambda = 0.0,
because it is possible for an IDWS calculation in NAMD to be
run this way.

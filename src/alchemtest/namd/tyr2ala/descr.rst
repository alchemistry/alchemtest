NAMD: free energy of tyrosine to alanine mutation in aqueous solution
=====================================================================

Free energy change from mutating a tyrosine (Y) residue into 
alanine (A) in the Ala-Tyr-Ala tripeptide in aqueous environment.

Data Set Characteristics:
    :Number of Legs: 2 (forward Y-->A, backward A-->Y)
    :Number of Windows: 20 for each leg
    :Length of Windows: 1000 ps (each window interspersed with 200 ps equilibration)
    :System Size: 1521 atoms
    :Temperature: 300 K
    :Pressure: 1 bar
    :Alchemical Pathway: Point mutation of Tyr to Ala using dual topology
                         hybrid molecule. Nonbonded interactions of perturbed
                         atoms are scaled with their environment.

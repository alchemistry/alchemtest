.. _usage: 

Basic usage
===========
All datasets in :mod:`alchemtest` are accessible via ``load_*`` functions, organized in submodules by the software package that generated them.
The current set of submodules are:

.. currentmodule:: alchemtest

.. autosummary::

   gmx
   amber

As an example, we can access the :ref:`gmx_benzene` dataset with::

    >>> from alchemtest.gmx import load_benzene
    >>> bz = load_benzene()

and use the resulting :class:`Bunch` object to introspect what this dataset includes.
In particular, it features a ``DESCR`` attribute with a human-readable description of the dataset::

    >>> print(bz.DESCR)
    Gromacs: Benzene in water
    =========================

    Benzene in water, alchemically turned into benzene in vacuum separated from water

    This dataset was generated using `MDPOW <https://github.com/Becksteinlab/MDPOW>`_, with
    the `Gromacs <http://www.gromacs.org/>`_ molecular dynamics engine. 

as well as the dataset itself::

    >>>  bz.data.keys()
    ['VDW', 'Coulomb']

which consists in this case of two alchemical legs, each having several files.
For this dataset each file happens to correspond to a simulation sampling a particular :math:`\lambda`::

    >>> bz.data['Coulomb']
    ['/usr/local/python3.6/site-packages/alchemtest/gmx/benzene/Coulomb/0000/dhdl.xvg.bz2',
     '/usr/local/python3.6/site-packages/alchemtest/gmx/benzene/Coulomb/0250/dhdl.xvg.bz2',
     '/usr/local/python3.6/site-packages/alchemtest/gmx/benzene/Coulomb/0500/dhdl.xvg.bz2',
     '/usr/local/python3.6/site-packages/alchemtest/gmx/benzene/Coulomb/0750/dhdl.xvg.bz2',
     '/usr/local/python3.6/site-packages/alchemtest/gmx/benzene/Coulomb/1000/dhdl.xvg.bz2']

These paths can be read by any appropriate parser for further analysis.
For this particular dataset, see :mod:`alchemlyb.parsing.gmx` for a good set of parsers.

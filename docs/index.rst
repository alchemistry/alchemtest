alchemtest: the simple alchemistry test set
===========================================

.. warning:: This library is in an **alpha** state. The library and the documentation is incomplete. Use in production at your own risk.

**alchemtest**  is a collection of test datasets for alchemical free energy calculations.
The datasets come from a variety of software packages, primarily molecular dynamics engines, and are used as the test set for `alchemlyb`_.
The package is standalone, however, and can be used for any purpose.
